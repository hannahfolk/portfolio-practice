Hannah Folk Portfolio
=======

## Description

This is my web development portfolio. There are About Me, Portfolio, and Contact sections. The About Me section is where I have a photo of myself along with a description of me. The Portfolio section I made by pulling stock photos of different games and backgrounds and adding titles to them. The Contact section is a form for people to enter their information, should they want to contact me.

## Process

I started out with just writing the HTML section with the headings and the different paragraphs. I actually started with the Contact section before moving on to the other sections. One of the hardest parts I had trouble with was trying to fit the header within the 960px width in the center of the page. I ended up making two different headings and laying one on top of the other.

## Credits

I used w3schools.com for references in building forms and buttons, as well as the overall layout of the website. I also asked Julio for help, especially with the header.
